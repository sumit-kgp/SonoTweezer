# Introduction
Our device to focus ultrasound waves to trap particles underwater based on the twin trap principle, details can be found in the article: https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/sonotweezer-an-acoustically-powered-end-effector-for-underwater-m

We present a matlab implementation of the original concept on airborne acoustic levitation kit, Ultraino, developed by Asier Marzo (https://github.com/asiermarzo/Ultraino). The given code allows simulation of acoustic fields generated by an array of symmetrically-placed transducers in air (Ultraino) and water (SonoTweezer) based on piston-source model. This model allows to simulate different mechanisms based on vortex and twin trap configurations. The device in the published article, SonoTweezer, uses six MHz-range immersible ultrasonic transducers to generate a twin trap for manipulating sub-millimeter particles.

# Implementation

Please use MATLAB v2019b onwards to use this code.

The code is divided into main programs:
- Ultraino_original: script to generate acoustic fields in air using both twin trap and vortex trap configurations with multiple rings of distributed transducers (parameters defined in the script)
- SonoTweezer_original: script to generate acoustic fields in water using twin trap configuration with a single ring of distributed transducers (parameters based on a model version from Imasonic SAS, can be tailored to preference)
- SonoTweezer_parametric_variation: script to tailor different configurations of acoustic fields in water besides SonoTweeezer configuration
- Directivity: program to plot acoustic pressure distribution around a single transducer 
Some parameters used in this study can be found in the table below:

These codes use the following different MATLAB functions:
- transducerloc: function that defines distribution of transducers in a space
- complex_pressure: computing pressure at a spatial point (Equation 4 in the article)
- directfunc: computing directivity function of a transducer based on defined properties (wavelength of sound in the medium, density and size of transducer)
- distance_and_angle_xy: allows computation of acoustic fields in XY-plane i.e. lateral plane (shown in fig. below)
- distance_and_angle_yz: allows computation of acoustic fields in YZ-plane i.e. longitudinal plane (shown in fig. below)
- potential field: allows computation of Gor'kov potential based on acoustic fields (Equation 2 in the article). Same function can be used with acoustic fields in all the possible planes.
