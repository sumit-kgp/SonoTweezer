# Introduction
Our device to focus ultrasound waves to trap particles underwater based on the twin trap principle, details can be found in the article: https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/sonotweezer-an-acoustically-powered-end-effector-for-underwater-m

We present a matlab implementation of the original concept on airborne acoustic levitation kit, Ultraino, developed by Asier Marzo (https://github.com/asiermarzo/Ultraino). The given code allows simulation of acoustic fields generated by an array of symmetrically-placed transducers in air (Ultraino) and water (SonoTweezer) based on piston-source model. This model allows to simulate different mechanisms based on vortex and twin trap configurations. The device in the published article, SonoTweezer, uses six MHz-range immersible ultrasonic transducers to generate a twin trap for manipulating sub-millimeter particles.

# Implementation

Please use MATLAB v2019b onwards to use this code. 

The code is divided into main programs:
- Ultraino_original: script to generate acoustic fields in air using both twin trap and vortex trap configurations with multiple rings of distributed transducers (parameters defined in the script)
- SonoTweezer_original: script to generate acoustic fields in water using twin trap configuration with a single ring of distributed transducers (parameters based on a model version from Imasonic SAS, can be tailored to preference)
- SonoTweezer_parametric_variation: script to tailor different configurations of acoustic fields in water besides SonoTweeezer configuration
- Directivity: program to plot pressure distribution around a single transducer

These codes use the following different MATLAB functions:
- complex_pressure: computing pressure at a spatial point (Equation 4 in the article)
- directfunc: computing directivity function of a transducer based on defined properties (wavelength of sound in the medium, density and size of transducer)
